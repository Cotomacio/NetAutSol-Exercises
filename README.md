# NetAutSol-Exercises
Hands-on exercises proposed on Building Network Automation Solutions by @ipspace

## 1. GETTING STARTED: BUILD THE LAB
- **Selecting the gear:** 
  - I decided to use Cisco VIRL in my lab for two reasons 
      [x] I am comfortable with the syntax
      [x] it's portable
  - The drawback is that it took me a while to setup and figure out how to use it, but the VIRL [book](https://www.amazon.com/VIRL-BOOK-Step-Step-Internet-ebook/dp/B01M0N517P) helped me a lot.
  
- **Building the lab:**
  - I used @ipspace [bash script](NetOpsWorkshop/install/install.sh) to be Up and Running very quick on my VM running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
  - In order to have a recover point after major changes on my environment I decided not use another technology (Vagrant) but use VM Fusion features like Clone and Snapshot

- **Set up Git and Github**
